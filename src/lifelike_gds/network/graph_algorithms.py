### CENTRALITY AND INFLUENCE

# some centralities https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/reference/algorithms/centrality.html
# eigenvector centrality just sums the eigenvector centralities of incoming nodes. It works for both directed and undirected. Symmetric vs non-symmetric R in source:
#        Power and Centrality: A Family of Measures.
#        American Journal of Sociology 92(5):1170â€“1182, 1986
#        http://www.leonidzhukov.net/hse/2014/socialnetworks/papers/Bonacich-Centrality.pdf
# Katz adds attenuation factor alpha so the weight of a path 3 edges long is alpha^3 where for eigenvector it is basically like using alpha==1
# one thing missing from these are a starting weight to the shortlist. Centralities will only appear because of cycles in a directed graph.
# a pagerank adds random jumps to any node so that fixes it, but we only want those jumps to shortlist genes.
# I think the solution is something like adding <1 probabilities for jumping to shortlist genes.
# pagerank adds damping factor alpha which is e.g. 0.85 according to wiki means that a normalized adjacency matrix A gets modified to alpha A + (1-alpha) /N so we get a probability 0.15 to jump to a random node.
# we don't want that.
# We also have assignment of outgoing edges to dangling nodes that is by default a uniform distribution:
# https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/reference/algorithms/generated/networkx.algorithms.link_analysis.pagerank_alg.pagerank.html#networkx.algorithms.link_analysis.pagerank_alg.pagerank
# So we either want to get edges onto shortlist genes from all nodes or from dangling and we either want to accomplish that by modifying the graph ourselves or maybe by tweaking the use of pagerank with its personalization parameter etc.
# after reading the pagerank code above from networkx I can see it is written such that personalization is controlling where those 1-alpha leaking jumps per iteration goes,
# and that dangling nodes takes all of their alpha remaining value and sends it to "dangling" which by default is the same as the personalization dict.
# So it seems I can get what I want through pagerank by tweaking those two args depending on how I want to use the 1-alpha leak and the dangling nodes.
